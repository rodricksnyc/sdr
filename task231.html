This finding holds across almost all broad and fine degree fields, with holders of engineering degrees having the highest fractions, over 70%, while holders of doctorates in psychological disciplines the lowest fractions, below 40%.">

<img src="assets/Bar_graph2.png" alt="Overview: the plot shows the fractions of SEH doctorate holders performing R&D as the primary or secondary work activity, among those residing and working in the US. These fractions are shown for each of the 8 broad fields of degree, and further broken down by the finer fields of degree within those. The results indicate that more than 60% are performing R&D activities overall. Holders of engineering degrees had the highest fractions, over 70%, while holders of doctorates in psychological disciplines had the lowest fractions, below 40%. Values: the numerical values presented in the bubble plot are as follows: TABLE OF VALUES FOR THE 77 FINE FIELDS ORGANIZED BY BROAD FIELD: BROAD FIELD 1	OVERALL FRACTION FINE FIELD 1.1	FRACTION FINE FIELD 1.2		FRACTION (ETC), BROAD FIELD 2	OVERALL FRACTION FINE FIELD 2.1 (ETC). Presentation: the X axis lists the 8 broad fields, and the Y axis measures the fractions performing R&D as percentages.  For the broad fields, the overall percentages are shown as short line segments in the plot.  Within each broad field, the percentages for the fine fields are shown as bubbles in the plot, with the size of each bubble proportional to the number of degree holders in that fine field.">


<img src="assets/Tree1.png" alt="Overview: the graph shows the 77 fine fields that constitute the Science, Engineering and Health doctoral degree fields and how they are arranged within 8 broad fields. Values: the degree field classification is as follows: HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFICATION OF THE FIELDS SCIENCE BIOLOGICAL, AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIFE SCIENCES ZOOLOGY CELL, CELLULAR BIOLOGY AND MOLECURAR BIOLOGY MICROBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND IMMUNOLOGY MICROLOGICAL SCIENCES IMMUNOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS. Presentation: the fields of degree are shown as a wheel diagram. The fine fields, sorted by broad fields, are listed along the outer rim of the wheel. The broader fields corresponding to each set of fine fields are shown on the inside of the wheel, providing a visual illustration of how fine and broad fields are related.">
