          SDR is an ongoing survey of doctorate recipients who received their degrees from U.S. academic institutions and are living and working around the world. The survey has been conducted regularly since 1973.

          The SDR is designed to provide demographic and career history information about science,
          engineering, and health doctorate holders. Government agencies and academic researchers
          use data and reports from the SDR to make planning decisions regarding science and
          engineering research, training, and employment opportunities. Employers also use the
          SDR to understand trends in employment sectors, industry types, and salary. Students who
          want to learn about the relationship between graduate education and careers often obtain
          valuable information from the SDR. <br><br>
          This survey is the only comprehensive source of data on the careers of science,
          engineering, and health doctorate holders from U.S. academic institutions. It serves as
          an essential and irreplaceable resource on the training, work experience, and career
          development of a highly educated population.

          The SDR tracks career interests and employment trends for a very important portion of the
          population: science, engineering, and health doctorate holders. Since we cannot interview
          the entire population of doctorate holders, we scientifically selected a sample from it,
          including you, to be part of the survey. Your responses represent not just you, but also
          many other highly educated individuals like you; if you do not share your career and work
          history with the SDR, you and those that you represent will not be accounted for. Your

          The survey includes people in a variety of employment situations. Learning that you've
          retired--whether you've retired but have since returned to work part time or full time, or
          whether you've stopped working entirely--is important information that makes SDR trend
          data more complete and more useful. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is especially
          interested in how the career paths of retirees may change over time and in the current
          economy--an economy in which some retirees need to return to work, perhaps in fields
          that are very different from the fields of their doctoral degrees, and in which some
          workers may retire either earlier or later than planned. The only way to track such
          career changes and trends is to include all respondents in the survey, even those
          retired individuals who intend to stay retired. Your participation can help to ensure

          Even when no changes come to mind initially, there may be minor changes in your situation

          Definitely. The National Science Foundation (NSF) and Westat maintain the highest standards
          of confidentiality. Your name and other identifying information, as well as that of all
          other participants, will be kept strictly confidential by the NSF and Westat as required
          by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 as amended, and the Confidential
          Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002. <br><br>
          No information obtained in the course of this survey may be disclosed in a manner in which the individual supplying the information is identifiable, except to a very small number of authorized staff at NSF and Westat, and then only for survey administrative purposes, not for dissemination. Any violation of your confidentiality is subject to penalties of up to five years in prison and/or as much as a $250,000 fine.

          All information captured in the SDR is treated as confidential, protected under the Privacy
          Act of 1974 and the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act
          (CIPSEA) of 2002. Both statutes mandate that SDR data must be exclusively used for
          statistical purposes. Under CIPSEA, data may not be released to unauthorized persons.
          Willful and knowing disclosure of protected data to unauthorized persons is a felony
          punishable by up to five years imprisonment and up to a $250,000 fine.
          <br><br>
          Per the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, your data are protected from
          cybersecurity risks through screening of the Federal systems that transmit your data.
          <br><br>
          Participation in the SDR is also entirely voluntary, and there are no penalties for
          failing to answer any particular question(s). A respondent's answers are never reported
          individually, but instead are grouped with answers from other persons in the survey to
          create statistical and analytical reports. In short, at no point does SDR identify
          individual respondents and NSF never publishes individual responses.

          Within the NSF is the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), a
          federal statistical agency. As mandated by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of
          2010, the mission of NCSES is to serve as a central Federal clearinghouse for the
          collection, interpretation, analysis, and dissemination of objective data on science,
          engineering, technology, and research and development. To accomplish this mission, NCSES
          is tasked to collect, acquire, analyze, report, and disseminate statistical data related
          to the science and engineering enterprise in the United States and other nations that is
          relevant and useful to practitioners, researchers, policymakers, and the public, including
          statistical data on--
          <br>   <br>
          <ol>
            <li>research and development trends;</li>
            <li>the science and engineering workforce;</li>
            <li>United States competitiveness in science, engineering, technology, and research and development; and </li>
            <li>the condition and progress of United States STEM education. </li>

          </ol>

          Prior to the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010, information for the SDR was
          collected under authority provided to NSF in the National Science Foundation Act of 1950.
          That Act states, "The National Science Foundation is authorized to provide a central
          clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, and analysis of data on scientific
          and engineering resources and to provide a source of information for policy
          formulation by other agencies of the Federal government."
