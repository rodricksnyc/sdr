      Your participation allows NSCES to use the SDR data to prepare two Congressionally mandated reports: <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19304/" target="_blank" class="custom-link t-white">

        Women, Minorities, and Persons with
        Disabilities in Science and Engineering

      <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/" target="_blank" class="custom-link t-white">Science &amp; Engineering Indicators</a>. More generally, your response to the SDR allows government agencies and academia to use these data for planning decisions regarding education. It is also used by employers to understand and predict employment, industry, and salary trends.

          <p class="mobileOnly">The 2017 SDR estimated that about 135,700 of approximately 1.1 million US-trained science, engineering, and health (SEH) doctorate recipients were residing abroad. They are found in many countries around the world, with the largest numbers in Asia (China and India in particular), North America (Canada) and Europe.<br><br>SOURCE: National Science Foundation, National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, Survey of Doctorate Recipients: 2017.</p>

          <img src="assets/Bar_graph2.png" alt="Overview: the plot shows the fractions of SEH doctorate holders performing R&D as the primary or secondary work activity, among those residing and working in the US. These fractions are shown for each of the 8 broad fields of degree, and further broken down by the finer fields of degree within those. The results indicate that more than 60% are performing R&D activities overall. Holders of engineering degrees had the highest fractions, over 70%, while holders of doctorates in psychological disciplines had the lowest fractions, below 40%. Values: the numerical values presented in the bubble plot are as follows: TABLE OF VALUES FOR THE 77 FINE FIELDS ORGANIZED BY BROAD FIELD: BROAD FIELD 1	OVERALL FRACTION FINE FIELD 1.1	FRACTION FINE FIELD 1.2		FRACTION (ETC), BROAD FIELD 2	OVERALL FRACTION FINE FIELD 2.1 (ETC). Presentation: the X axis lists the 8 broad fields, and the Y axis measures the fractions performing R&D as percentages.  For the broad fields, the overall percentages are shown as short line segments in the plot.  Within each broad field, the percentages for the fine fields are shown as bubbles in the plot, with the size of each bubble proportional to the number of degree holders in that fine field.">
